<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Aluminate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-melting</li><li>Sintered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium Aluminate market can be divided into two main types: pre-melting and sintered. Pre-melting calcium aluminate is produced by melting raw materials in a furnace, resulting in a homogeneous mixture that is then cooled and crushed into a powder form. On the other hand, sintered calcium aluminate is made by compacting the raw materials into a mold and then heating them at high temperatures until they bond together. Both types of calcium aluminate have specific applications in industries such as construction, refractories, and wastewater treatment.</p></p>
