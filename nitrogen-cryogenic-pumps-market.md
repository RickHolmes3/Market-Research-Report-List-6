<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitrogen Cryogenic Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nitrogen cryogenic pumps market is categorized into two main types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize kinetic energy to move nitrogen by converting rotational energy into pressure, making them efficient for high flow rates. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of nitrogen and then forcing it into the discharge line, ensuring consistent flow even at high pressures. Each type serves specific applications based on operational requirements and system design.</p></p>
