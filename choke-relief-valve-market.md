<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Choke Relief Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Through</li><li>Angled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Choke relief valves come in two main types: straight through and angled. Straight through choke relief valves have a linear flow path, allowing for direct and efficient flow control. On the other hand, angled choke relief valves have a bent or angled flow path, which can provide more flexibility in installations where space is limited or where a specific flow direction is required. Both types of choke relief valves are designed to safely and effectively relieve pressure buildup in pipelines or systems.</p></p>
