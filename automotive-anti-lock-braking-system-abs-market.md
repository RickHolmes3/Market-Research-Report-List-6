<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Anti-Lock Braking System</li><li>Hydraulic Anti-Lock Braking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) is designed to prevent wheels from locking up during heavy braking, improving vehicle control and reducing stopping distances. Two main types are Pneumatic ABS, which uses compressed air to regulate brake pressure, and Hydraulic ABS, which uses hydraulic pressure. Pneumatic ABS is commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles like trucks, while Hydraulic ABS is more common in passenger vehicles. Both systems work by automatically adjusting brake pressure to prevent wheel lock-up and ensure safer braking performance.</p></p>
