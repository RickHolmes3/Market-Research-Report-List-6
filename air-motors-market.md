<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Motors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vane Air Motor</li><li>Piston Air Motor</li><li>Gear Air Motor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air motors are classified into three main types: vane air motors, piston air motors, and gear air motors. Vane air motors utilize rotating vanes to generate mechanical energy, making them suitable for low-speed, high-torque applications. Piston air motors use reciprocating pistons to convert compressed air into rotational motion, making them ideal for high-speed, low-torque tasks. Gear air motors use gears to transfer power from the compressed air to the rotor, providing a balance of speed and torque for various industrial applications.</p></p>
