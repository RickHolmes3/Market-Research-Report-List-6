<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Boom Barrier System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Barriers</li><li>Electromechanical Barriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic boom barrier systems are divided into two main types: hydraulic barriers and electromechanical barriers. Hydraulic barriers use fluid power to operate the barrier arm, providing high reliability and durability. Electromechanical barriers, on the other hand, utilize an electric motor and gears to control the barrier arm movement. Both types have their own advantages and are suitable for different applications, with hydraulic barriers being preferred for heavy-duty operations and electromechanical barriers being more cost-effective and easier to install.</p></p>
