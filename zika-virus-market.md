<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Zika Virus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molecular Test</li><li>Serologic Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Zika virus market is divided into two primary types: molecular tests and serologic tests. Molecular tests, such as RT-PCR, detect the virus's genetic material, offering rapid results and high specificity during active infection. Serologic tests identify antibodies in the blood, indicating past exposure to the virus, but may have limitations in sensitivity and timing. Both test types play crucial roles in diagnosing Zika virus infections, guiding public health responses, and managing outbreaks effectively.</p></p>
