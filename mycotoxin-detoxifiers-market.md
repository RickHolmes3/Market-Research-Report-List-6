<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mycotoxin Detoxifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mycotoxin Binders</li><li>Mycotoxin Modifiers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mycotoxin detoxifiers market is primarily categorized into two types: mycotoxin binders and mycotoxin modifiers. Mycotoxin binders are substances that absorb and immobilize mycotoxins in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing their absorption into the bloodstream. They are often used in animal feed to enhance livestock health. Mycotoxin modifiers, on the other hand, alter the chemical structure of mycotoxins, rendering them less harmful or inactive. Both types play crucial roles in improving food safety and maintaining animal wellbeing.</p></p>
