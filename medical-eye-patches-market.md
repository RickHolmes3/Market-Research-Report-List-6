<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Eye Patches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Viscous</li><li>Inviscid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical eye patches come in two main types – viscous and inviscid. Viscous eye patches are designed with a thicker, gel-like material that conforms to the shape of the eye for a more secure fit. These patches are often preferred for patients with sensitive or injured eyes as they provide more protection and support. On the other hand, inviscid eye patches are made with a thinner, adhesive material that adheres easily to the skin without causing discomfort. These patches are often used for minor eye injuries or post-surgery care.</p></p>
