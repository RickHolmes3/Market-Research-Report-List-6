<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metallic brake pads market primarily comprises semi-metallic and low metallic NAO (Non-Asbestos Organic) brake pads. Semi-metallic brake pads contain a blend of metal fibers and organic materials, offering excellent heat dissipation and durability, making them suitable for high-performance vehicles. In contrast, low metallic NAO brake pads have reduced metal content, resulting in quieter operation and minimal dust production while still delivering good braking performance. Both types cater to diverse vehicle needs, balancing performance, noise, and environmental considerations.</p></p>
