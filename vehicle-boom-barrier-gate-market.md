<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Boom Barrier Gate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight</li><li>Crank</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vehicle boom barrier gates come in different types based on their opening mechanism. Straight boom barrier gates open and close in a straight line, ideal for spaces with limited height restrictions. Crank boom barrier gates, on the other hand, use a crank mechanism to lift the barrier in a vertical arc when opening. These gates are commonly used in areas where a straight barrier may not be practical due to space restrictions or traffic flow considerations. Both types offer efficient and secure access control for vehicles.</p></p>
