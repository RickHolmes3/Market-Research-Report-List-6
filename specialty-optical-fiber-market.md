<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specialty Optical Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multimode PM Fiber</li><li>Single-Mode PM Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The specialty optical fiber market encompasses two main types: multimode polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber and single-mode PM fiber. Multimode PM fiber supports multiple light modes and is ideal for short-distance applications, providing higher data throughput over shorter distances. In contrast, single-mode PM fiber allows only one light mode to propagate, making it suitable for long-distance communications with lower signal loss. Both types are critical in telecommunications, sensing, and fiber-optic systems, catering to distinct application requirements.</p></p>
